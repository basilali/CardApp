# Card Manipulation App

A React-based card manipulation application that allows users to interact with a standard deck of playing cards in various ways.

## Features

1. **Dealing Cards**:

   - Click on any card to select/deselect it
   - Selected cards are highlighted with a blue border
   - When two cards are selected, they will automatically swap positions

   - RESET: Returns all cards to the deck and shuffles them
   - SHUFFLE: Randomly rearranges cards in the play area
   - WILDCARD: Adds a special wildcard to the play area
